This upgrade migrates from LXD to Incus !

It does NOT handle migration as it's unstable, but rather creates a fresh `incus` configuration.

If you still want to migrate, you need to:

* Install the incus app: `yunohost app install incus`
* Run the migration tool: `lxd-to-incus`
* Remove LXD: `yunohost app remove lxd`
* Rename the `lxdbr0` or `lxdbr1` network to `incusbr0`:

```bash
incus network detach-profile lxdbr1 default
incus network rename lxdbr1 incusbr0
incus network attach-profile incusbr0 default
```

â€¦ Maybe some other steps ?
